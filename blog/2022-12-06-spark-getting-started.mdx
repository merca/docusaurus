I do work as a developer so I code almost every day. As part of my 100 days of code challage I decided to do some coding in my free time. I will be using this blog to document my progress.

For some time I have been thinking that I should have some small snippets so that I dont have to start from scrach on the most basic things.

Today I started with a simple snippet to create a dataframe from a list of tuples. I have used this snippet in the past and I thought it would be a good idea to have it in a place where I can find it easily.

Also the basic for reading and writing data from Azure Blob Storage is also included.

I'm mostly using Databricks for my work and I will be using it for this challenge as well.

I always include following imports in my notebooks when I start developing. After I'm done with a feature, I clean up and include only used imports.

```python
from pyspark.sql.functions import *
from pyspark.sql.types import *
```

I also like to have a function to create a dataframe from a list of tuples. I use this function a lot when I'm testing my code.

```python
def create_df_from_tuples(tuples, schema):
    return spark.createDataFrame(tuples, schema)
```

I also like to have a function to read data from Azure Blob Storage. I use this function a lot when I'm testing my code.

```python
def read_from_blob_storage(path, format):
    return spark.read.format(format).load(path)
```
